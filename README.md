# (Template) Colyseus + Discord Embedded App SDK

This Project Template is a starting point for crafting HTML5 multiplayer games on Discord.

## Template Project Structure

We have provided a default project structure to get you started. This is as follows:

- `client` - Contains the game & Discord SDK source code.
- `client/main.js` - The main entry point for the client. This contains the game & Discord SDK configuration which starts the game.
- `client/scenes/` - The Phaser Scenes are in this folder.
- `client/assets/` - Contains game assets(sprites, sounds, spritesheets, etc).
- `server/server.js` - Contains Discord SDK for OAuth2 connection
